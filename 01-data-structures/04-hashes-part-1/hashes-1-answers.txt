Q: Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.
A: It doesn't reduce the possiblities of collisions.  It can often create an array that is much larger than is strictly needed (what if you only need to add one hash/item?.  
This would result in an excess of memory usage.
