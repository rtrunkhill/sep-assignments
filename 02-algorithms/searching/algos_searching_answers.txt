3.Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,...
fib(10) = 55
fib(11) = 89
fib(120 = 144

Benchmark comparison between recursive and iterative searches:
recursive:
  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.001735)
iterative:
  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.000017)

1.Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? 
Because it's unsorted, i'd use a linear iterative search

2.Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? 
Because it's sorted, i'd use a binary iterative search.
