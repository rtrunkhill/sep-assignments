1.Write out a generic SELECT statement.
    SELECT (what you're looking for)
    FROM (the table you're looking in)
    <optional> WHERE <condition of search>;

2.Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.
    SELECT a Single Free Woman to help you with your search

3.Create a pets database. Create a dogs table using this file. From the dogs table with the columns id, name, gender, age, weight, intake_date, breed, and in_foster.
    CREATE TABLE pets (ID integer, NAME varchar(25), GENDER varchar(6), AGE float, WEIGHT(lbs) float, INTAKE_DATE date, BREED varchar(20), IN_FOSTER? boolean);
    
    a.Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.
        SELECT name, gender, age
        FROM pets
        WHERE gender LIKE '%Labrador%';
    
    b.Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.
        SELECT id
        FROM pets
        WHERE age < 1;
    
    c.Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.
        SELECT name, age
        FROM pets
        WHERE gender = 'female'
        AND weight > 35;
    
    d.Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.
        SELECT *
        FROM pets
        WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%Shephard%';
    
    e.Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.
        SELECT id, age, weight, breed
        FROM pets
        WHERE weight > 60
        OR breed LIKE '%Great Dane%';

4.From the cats table below, what pieces of data would be returned from these queries?
    a.SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;
        | name   | adoption_date |
        |--------|---------------|
        |Mushi   | 2016-03-22    |
        |Seashell|               |
        |Azul    | 2016-04-17    |
        |Victoire| 2016-09-01    |
        |Nala    |               |
    
    b. SELECT name, age FROM cats;
        | name   | age  |
        |--------|------|
        |Mushi   | 1    |
        |Seashell| 7    |
        |Azul    | 3    |
        |Victoire| 7    |
        |Nala    | 1    |
    

5.From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.
    a.Display all the information about all of the available cats.
        SELECT *
        FROM cats
        WHERE adoption_date IS null;
    
    b.Choose one cat of each age to show to potential adopters.
        SELECT *
        FROM cats
        WHERE name = 'Nala'
        AND name = 'Seashell';
        
        (editors note: the other cats on the table have all been adopted!)
    
    c.Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.
        SELECT name
        FROM cats;

6.List each comparison operator and explain, in your own words, when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.
    >  - Comparing a value larger than another: I like all wines with an age greater than 5 years old.  
    <  - Comparing a value smaller than another:  I only buy cars less than 5 years old.
    >= - Comparing a value larger than or the same as another: I like all wines with an age 5 years old or more.  
    <= - Comparing a value smaller than or the same as another: I only buy cars 5 years old and younger
    =  - Comparing a value that is the same as another: I'll take six of one, or a half dozen of the other
    <> - Two values are not equal: 6 eggs are is not the same as 7 eggs
    AND - Both conditions must be met: I need steak AND potatoes
    OR - Only a single condition must be met: I'm not that hungry, just give me the Steak OR the potatoes please.
    NOT - Do not include anything after this operator:  I'll take the Steak and the Chicken but NOT the fish, eww.

7.From the cats table below, what data would be returned from these queries?
    a.SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;
        | name   |
        |--------|
        |Seashell|
        |Nala    |
    
    b.SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;
        | name   |
        |--------|
        |Mushi   |
        |Seashell|
        |Victoire|
        |Nala    |
        
    c.SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;
        | ID     |
        |--------|
        |00003   |
        |00004   |
