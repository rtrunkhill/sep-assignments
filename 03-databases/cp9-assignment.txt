1.Create a database for the model we built in the example. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and inserts sample data. Write queries that demonstrate the following scenarios:
    a.Find a guest who exists in the database and has not booked a room.
        SELECT * FROM guests WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT guest_id FROM visits);
        
    b.Find bookings for a guest who has booked two rooms for the same dates.
        SELECT guest_id, check_in, COUNT(*) FROM visits GROUP BY guest_id, check_in HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
    
    c.Find bookings for a guest who has booked one room several times on different dates.
        SELECT guest_id, room_id, COUNT(*) FROM visits GROUP BY guest_id, room_id HAVING count(*) > 1;
        
    d.Count the number of unique guests who have booked the same room.

2.Design a data model for students and the classes they have taken. The model should include the students' grades for a given class.
    a.Work through the questions from the example above.
    b.Document any assumptions you make about what data should be stored, what data types should be used, etc., and include them in a text file.
    c.Ask questions of your mentor if you are unsure about parts of your model.
    d.Draw the model using the notation used in the checkpoint and submit a picture. You can also use a tool like StarUML or quickdatabasediagrams.com if you choose.
3.Build a database for the students/classes data model. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and inserts sample data (the questions below will help you create the data). Write queries that demonstrate the following scenarios:
    a.Find all students who have taken a particular class.
    b.Count the number of each grade (using letter grades A-F) earned in a particular class.
    c.Find class names and the total number of students who have taken each class in the list.
